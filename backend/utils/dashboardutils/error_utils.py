    Provide a mechanism to simplify the error maintenance in the code.

    The key component for the programmer is the errors dictionary which must follow a simple schema to organize
    errors and exceptions to raise for any given situation. Any way this dictionary is built, the data to provide to
    the methods here must have as key a string from the ErrorElement enumeration and for value as described next.

    errors = {
        '<type>': {
            'sub-type': {
                ErrorElement.DEBUG.name: [<list of whatever messages to produce for debugging purposes>, <this list
                must use {} for data substitution>],
                ErrorElement.EXCEPTION.name: <ExceptionMessage instance with associated message to provide for the
                exception>
                }

    NOTE:
        - the [<type>][<sub-type>] organization is optional and any depth may be used.
        - only the required keys from ErrorElement should be used. Any key not defined will raise a KeyError so the
        programmer knows it's missing from the dictionary.
